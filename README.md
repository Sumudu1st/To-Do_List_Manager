# To-Do_List_Manager
An abstract data type to manage a to-do list application.

1. Designed and implemented the `Task` class that represents a single task in the to-do list. Each task has properties such as a unique identifier, title, description, due date, and status (completed or not).

2. Created an abstract data type called `TaskList` to manage the to-do list. The `TaskList` provides operations to add a new task, remove an existing task, mark a task as completed, and retrieve tasks based on different criteria (e.g., all tasks, completed tasks, tasks due today).

A program that demonstrates the usage of the `TaskList` class. It should allow users to interact with the to-do list by performing actions like adding tasks, removing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and listing tasks based on different criteria.
